# SBMS0 Troubleshooting

## SBMS0 Won't Boot

A few reports were made to the [electrodacus mailing list from early 2020](https://groups.google.com/g/electrodacus/c/X4-KFQrkaL0/m/dnyNCbNSBgAJ) of SBMSO units halting at initial power on, with only a single line displayed with the "SBMSO" banner.

Speculation is that this is a problem with the microcontroller's oscillator being susceptible to humidity. Gently heating the SBMSO to eliminate any moisture may help, or simply leaving the unit powered on for a time. Furthermore, it would seem once the unit is running it generates sufficient heat to deter moisture, there have been no reports of a unit locking up or similar once booted.
